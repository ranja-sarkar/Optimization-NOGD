When we talk about convex and concave functions, we think of the **Hessian**. The Hessian matrix has two important utilities:
- to know whether a function is concave or convex

- to determine whether a critical point is a local minimum, a local maximum, or a saddle point [If the gradient of a function is zero at some point, that is f(x)=0, then function f has a critical point at x]
