# Gradient & Hessian

Gradient is the vector of first order derivatives of a scalar field. A gradient guides you with the direction in a landscape.

Hessian is a matrix of second order partial derivatives of a scaler field. A Hessian not only guides, it also tells if you're climbing, falling, or stuck in the landscape.
Those are inflexion points, extremum, and saddle points of the function.

Jacobian is a matrix of gradients of a vector field.

# Classification of Optimization Problems

Optimization uses a rigorous mathematical model to determine the most efficient solution to a described problem. 

One must first identify an objective function, a quantitative measure of the model examples of which are profit, cost, energy. The objective is subject to constraints such as resources, time. 

 1. **Linear Programming (LP)** ->  Objective function and constraints are both linear
 
 2. **Quadratic Programming (QP)** -> Objective function is quadratic and constraints are linear
 
 3. **Non-Linear Programming (NLP)** -> Objective function or (atleast one) constraint is non-linear

# LP example

 **Objective function**:
 
 1. Goal is to maximize total profit
 2. Products A and B are sold at 25$ and 20$ respectively

    
 **Constraints**:
 
 1. Product A requires 20 resource units, product B 12 units
 2. Only 1800 resource units are available per day
 3. Both products require a production time of 1/15 hour
 4. A working day has a total of 8 hours.

**Mathematical Formulation:**

Objective function maximizes total sales.

Resource and time constraints are given by:

x1 = #items of product A, x2 = #items of product B

Optimal x1 and x2 are 45 and 75 respectively.

In my book (**chapter 4**), I have briefly touched upon convex functions and their optimization.

When we talk about convex and concave functions, we think of the **Hessian**. The Hessian matrix has two important utilities:
- to know whether a function is concave or convex

<img width="562" alt="22" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2114793-4dd7-43df-b504-9019046439ad" />
  
- to determine whether a critical point is a local minimum, a local maximum, or a saddle point [If the gradient of a function is zero at some point, that is f(x)=0, then function f has a critical point at x]
