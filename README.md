The space for searching global or local minimum solution wrt cost/objective function can be continuous or discrete.

**Stochastic Optimization Algorithms** for continuous variable values in cost function:

1. Simulated annealing

It is a metaheuristic  probabilistic technique to approximate global optimization in a large search space of a physical process wherein the system energy is minimized.

2. Genetic algorithms (evolutionary optimization)

An evolutionary algorithm is a heuristic approach to solving problems that would take too long to exhaustively process using deterministic methods.
